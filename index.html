      Are you trying to make a <strong>Minecraft Resource Pack </strong>but just can't figure it out? 
      This article will help you do just that.
    </p>

    <p>
      For this tutorial, you can use this <a href="DOWNLOADLINK">Resource Pack Template.</a> 
      It will not affect anything if you use your own, but this report will be directed towards it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resource Packs work in a very simple way, there is the
      <br> <strong>MAIN FOLDER (NAME OF PACK)</strong>
      <br>which includes a json (JavaScript Object Notation) file, and the assets folder. 
      Most aspects are changed in the assets folder. Anything in the assets folder in the resource pack will override anything in the base Minecraft pack.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are creating a pack, then start with a base folder, name it whatever you like. 
      The name won’t be shown in-game, only in the files, so don’t worry about it. 
      Inside of this folder, we will create a new folder, which will be our resource pack, for understanding purposes, it will be referred to as "ShellPack". 
      Inside of ShellPack, there should be 3 files. These include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>assets (folder)</li>
      <li>pack.mcmeta (json)</li>
      <li>pack.png (png)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We will start with the pack.png. This is the image shown on the resource pack in the resource pack selection menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take whatever image that you wish to display, and drag it into ShellPack. 
      Rename it to "pack.png". Images should be square and render best if the resolution is 512x512 or less but it shouldn't be a problem. 
      (if there is a problem, try to keep the resolution a power of 2)
    </p>

    <p>
      pack.mcmeta will be next. To start, create a new text document. Now open it. 
      This should already be in the template pack. Paste this code:
    </p>

    <pre><code>{
  "pack": {
    "pack_format": 64,
    "description": "RESOURCE PACK DESCRIPTION"
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Now, where the code says '"pack_format":64,' change the 64 to the corresponding pack format. 
      The code has a bit of writing "RESOURCE PACK DESCRIPTION". Change the description to your desired description.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open your assets folder, this should contain ‘minecraft’ (folder). Inside of this folder, there will be our 13 main sections of our pack:
    </p>

    <input type="checkbox"> atlases </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> blockstates </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> equipment </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> font </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> items </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> lang </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> models </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> particles </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> post_effect </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> shaders </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> texts </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> textures </input><br>
    <input type="checkbox"> waypoint_style </input><br>

    <p>
      To change a block texture, import a new PNG into your resource pack's textures/block folder. 
      For example, to change the oak log, add "oak_log.png" or "oak_log_top.png" as needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      To rename entities like creepers, edit lang/en_us.json in your resource pack:
    </p>

    <pre><code>{
  "entity.minecraft.creeper": "Bomber",
  "subtitles.entity.creeper.death": "Bomber dies",
  "subtitles.entity.creeper.hurt": "Bomber hurts",
  "subtitles.entity.creeper.primed": "Bomber hisses",
  "death.attack.creeper": "%1$s was blown up by a Bomber",
  "death.attack.creeper.player": "%1$s was blown up by a Bomber whilst fighting %2$s",
  "item.minecraft.creeper_spawn_egg": "Bomber Spawn Egg"
}</code></pre>
